## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#64B5F6) to promote a sense of calmness and focus. This will contrast well on a light background, and suggests productivity without being overbearing.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F8FF) to keep the interface bright and airy. It is only 10% saturated and provides a gentle contrast, so the focus will remain on the lists and tasks.
- Accent color: Muted cyan (#4DD0E1) to draw attention to interactive elements, like the 'Add New List' and the drag and drop affordances. Cyan provides a close harmony with the blue shades of the main theme.
- Clear, readable, sans-serif font for all text elements.
- Card-based design with rounded corners and subtle shadows to mimic Trello's interface.
- Simple, consistent icons for actions like adding, editing, and deleting.
